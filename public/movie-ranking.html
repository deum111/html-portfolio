    <h3>Elf</h3>
    <p>The best Christmas movie ever.</p>

    <h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
    <p>Really great drama with great performances from the Robin Williams and Matt Damon.</p>

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>Awesome visuals directed by Christoper Nolan, one of the best filmmakers of all-time. I also love the iconic soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer.  </p>

    <h3>Kung Fu Hustle</h3>
    <p>Hilarious film that should be watched with subtitles. This is unironically the best live-action anime of all-time.</p>

    <h3>Step Brothers</h3>
    <p>Wild film with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. I love its quotability. </p>

    <h3>The Goonies</h3>
    <p>This is a fun movie of a group of misfits going on an adventure. A classic that I enjoyed growing up. </p>

    <h3>Tropic Thunder</h3>
    <p>One of the funniest action-comedies of all-time with wild humor and a wild cast of actors.</p>
